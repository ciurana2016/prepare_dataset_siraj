This is a submission for the "Pokemon" challenge by @Sirajology on [Youtube](https://youtu.be/0xVqLJe9_CY).

## Overview
On this challenge we where asked to preprocess some data and then try and classify pokemons by type.

On this repo you will find a "preprocess.py" and "predict.py" that are just functions, the other files are attempts to classify the data.

The only relevant file for the challenge is the preprocess.py file.

## Dependencies
* sklearn (http://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html)
* numpy (http://www.numpy.org/)
* pandas (http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/install.html)

## Usage
Just run any file other than preprocess.py and predict.py
